Hello there! 

I am a student of 42 Vienna.
This is my "FT_PRINTF" project. You can see the way I created 

‼️‼️‼️Please DO NOT just copy the project. If you cope my project you will get "Cheating" and it won't be good for you in future.‼️‼️‼️

To run tester you need to drop the "printfTester" folder in your project folder than follow next steps in terminal: 1️⃣```cd testerPrintf```  ->  2️⃣```make m```.
The tester is made by ```https://github.com/Tripouille/printfTester```

I wish you good luck in 42School

And remember, the key to succes is number 42
